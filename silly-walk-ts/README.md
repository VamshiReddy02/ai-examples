## Silly Walk (TypeScript)

This is a minimal example of using the Fermyon Serverless AI inside of your serverless function.

The code is in `src/index.ts`

## Building and Running

> This version is pre-release, so you will need to edit package.json to point to your JS SDK.

In this directory, run `npm install` followed by `spin build`. You can run it locally with `spin up`, but unless you have a very powerful system, this will be slow. To deploy to Fermyon Cloud and use Serverless AI, do a `spin deploy`.
